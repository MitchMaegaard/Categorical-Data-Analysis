## How to complete the homework.

If you've made it this far, then you've already downloaded the HW for this week.  I suggest that you keep all of the materials, including this .rmd file,  for the week in one folder.  It will help to set the working directory to the folder that contains the HW materials.  You can do this by opening the rmd file in an RStudio editor window and then using the menu commands Session -> Set Working Directory -> To Source File Location.

You'll be adding R code and typing answers in the designated spaces throughout this document.  At the end of the week you'll submit the .rmd file and the "knitted" html document to the dropbox on D2L.
